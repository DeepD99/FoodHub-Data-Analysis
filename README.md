# FoodHub Order Analysis

## Context
The number of restaurants in New York is increasing rapidly. Many students and busy professionals rely on these restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. **Online food delivery services** provide a convenient way for them to enjoy meals from their favorite restaurants.  

**FoodHub**, a food aggregator company, offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app. The app enables customers to place orders directly with restaurants, and a **delivery person** from the company picks up and delivers the food.  

### How It Works:
1. Customers place orders via the app.  
2. The restaurant receives and confirms the order.  
3. A delivery person is assigned to pick up the order.  
4. The delivery person collects the food and confirms pickup.  
5. The food is delivered to the customer's location.  
6. The customer rates the order.  

FoodHub earns revenue by collecting a fixed margin from each delivery order placed through the platform.
